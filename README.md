# ⚠️Important for contributors⚠️
- Discuss in discord if you have question.
- It is recommended to come back and **check for new phrases regularly when you are free**.
- We will always **build the game with the latest files (as of the build date) in the repo**, whatever appears in the files, will be packed in the game.
### Formatting
- If you see empty lines, go to the English translation file for the phrase,**OR leave it blank, the game will apply the English phrase automatically. Notice that **the last line is always empty**.
- Each line is a separate phrase. Make sure the number of lines for each phrase matches the key in the [Keys file](/DLLocalization_Keys.bytes), otherwise the game will not be able to read the correct translation.
- Line #3 in each file is **the language name in your language** (e.g. `English` in [English file](/DLLocalization_English.bytes), `中文（简体）` (Chinese Simplified) in [Chinese file](/DLLocalization_ChineseSimplified.bytes).
### Placeholders
- Translations may contain placeholders that will later be replaced with actual content when game is running.
  > For instance: `\n` (Make new line), `\t` (tab), `#Level#` (Level Name), `{0}` (Other), etc.
- These placeholders usually do not need to be translated. If you are not sure whether a translation is needed, you can refer to the translations in other languages (e.g. [English file](/DLLocalization_English.bytes), and [Chinese file](/DLLocalization_ChineseSimplified.bytes)).
