# ⚠️Important for contributors⚠️
- Discuss in discord if you have question.
- It is recommended to come back and check for new phrases regularly when you are free.
### Formatting
- If you see empty lines, go to the English translation file for the phrase. Notice that **the last line is always empty**.
- Each line is a separate phrase. Make sure the number of lines for each phrase matches the key in the [Key file](https://github.com/DL-Community/DLCE-Translations/blob/main/DLLocalization_Keys.bytes), otherwise the game will not be able to read the correct translation.
### Placeholders
- Translations may contain placeholders that will later be replaced with actual content in the game.
  > For instance: "\n" "\t" "#Level#" "{0}"
- These placeholders usually do not need to be translated. If you are not sure whether a translation is needed, you can refer to the translations in other languages.
